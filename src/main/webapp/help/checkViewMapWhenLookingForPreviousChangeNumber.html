    <b>Check Viewmap Matches When looking for Last build</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Useful when using a dynamically generated viewmap.<br>
   When this is enabled, when looking for the previous change number, Jenkins/Hudson will only consider builds with a matching view map.
   This is useful when a single build can build multiple lines.
